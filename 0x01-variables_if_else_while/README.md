|0-positive_or_negative.c|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. And it prints  whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. <br> - The output of this program is: <br> The number, followed by <br> * if the number is greater than 0: is positive <br> * if the number is 0: is zero <br> * if the number is less than 0: is negative <br> followed by a new line <br> Example output: -520693284 is negative|
|1-last_digit.c|This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. it prints he last digit of the number stored in the variable n. <br> - The output of this program is: <br> The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by the string is, followed by <br> * if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5 <br> * if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0 <br> * if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0 <br> followed by a new line <br>Example output: Last digit of 629438752 is 2 and is less than 6 and not 0|
|2-print_alphabet.c|A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. <br> Task: <br> - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) <br> - All your code should be in the main function <br> - You can only use putchar twice in your code <br> Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz|
|3-print_alphabets.c|A  program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. <br> Task: <br> - You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) <br> - All your code should be in the main function <br> - You can only use putchar three times in your code <br> Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|
|4-print_alphabt.c|A  program that prints the alphabet in lowercase(except q and e) using putchar, followed by a new line. <br> Output: abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz|
|5-print_numbers.c|A  program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. <br> Output: 0123456789|
|6-print_numberz.c|A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.(Without using any variable of type char, using  the putchar function)<br> Output: 0123456789|
|7-print_tebahpla.c|A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.(Using only putchar) <br> zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba|
|8-print_base16.c|A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. (Using putchar three times in your code) <br> Output: 0123456789abcdef|
|9-print_comb.c|A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. <br> - Numbers are  separated by , followed by a space. <br> - Numbers are printed in ascending order.<br> - Maximum use of putchat is 4 times. <br>- Not allowed to use char data type <br> Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |
