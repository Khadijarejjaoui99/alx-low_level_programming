Those files were created based on the followig tasks:
|Task Number|Description|Expected Output|
|---------|-----------|-------------|
|Task-0|create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0. <br> - Compile using the following command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main|0 is zero|
|Task-1|Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.<br>- Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code. <br>- You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task. <br> compile using: gcc -std=gnu89 1-main.c -o 1-main|./1-main should give <br> Infinite loop incoming :( <br>Infinite loop avoided! \o/<br> and wc -l 1-main.c is <br> 24 1-main.c|
|Task-2|Fix the code in 2-largest_number_before_debugging.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.<br> To compile use the following command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 2-largest_number.c 2-main.c -o 2-main|972 is the largest number|
|Task-3|This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.<br>Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000. <br>Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years. <br> - You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31). <br> - You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427). <br> To compile gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 3-convert_day.c 3-print_remaining_days.c 3-main_b.c -o 3-main_b|Date: 04/01/1997<br>Day of the year: 91<br>Remaining days: 274<br> Date: 02/29/2000<br>Day of the year: 61<br>Remaining days: 305|
